This directory contains example Grasshopper definitions for testing the analyzer.

## Sample Files

### 1. simple_definition.json
A basic Grasshopper definition with:
- 5-10 components
- Basic wire connections
- Minimal issues
- Good for testing basic functionality

### 2. medium_complexity.json
A medium-sized definition with:
- 50-100 components
- Multiple groups
- Some common issues (unnamed params, dangling outputs)

- All lint rule violations for testing

## How to Use

### With MCP Server
```bash
# Analyze a sample file
python mcp_server.py

# In Claude:
"Analyze examples/simple_definition.json"
```

### With Standalone
1. Open the definition in Grasshopper
2. Add analyzer component
3. Run analysis

## Creating Your Own Examples

To add new examples:

1. Create definition in Grasshopper
2. Export to JSON using utilities/export_to_json.py
3. Add to this directory
4. Update this README

## File Format
